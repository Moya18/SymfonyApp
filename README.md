# S&T Dev Candidate Test

This is the S&T Developer candidate test, it's designed to ensure one of the following:

1. You're familiarized with some of the essential tools we use in our day to day training
2. You can learn the basics of the aforementioned tools without supervision

In its core it's a simple Symfony 2.8 app which requires a few trivial fixes that should
help you demonstrate basic proficiency.

The instructions for this test are as follows:

1. Start a Docker container from the included Dockerfile (we'll assume you used port 8080)
2. Acquire shell access to the started container
3. Install the project dependencies using Composer
4. Check within http://localhost:8080 and troubleshoot the error by reading the app/logs/prod.log
   file
5. Once fixed, follow the instructions within the app, we recommend reading only the code under 
   `src/AppBundle`. Anything else is generated by Symfony and was not modified in any way 
   whatsoever.

Because you're meant to be able to do this with minimal help this README is intentionally
vague.

Good luck!
